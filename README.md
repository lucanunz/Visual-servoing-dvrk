# Visual_servoing_dvrk
Repository of the code developed for the Medical Robotics exam at Universit√† degli studi di Roma La Sapienza.\
The code for the visual servoing scheme was developed by me and Giovanbattista Gravina (gianba.gravina7@gmail.com) in a Visual Studio project.\
The goal is to follow the Patient Side Manipulators (PSMs) of the Da Vinci Surgical robot with the Endoscopic Camera (ECM).\
This code is also integrated in other code where two Geomagic devices control the PSMs, and the image seen by the ECM is projected on an Oculus Rift device.\
The following video show the final result

In this repo the .ttt file that is the CoppeliaSim scene used is avilable, as well as a report that explains this project.
